# Main Goal

1. The Web Services, like the HTTP protocol, are stateless and have active and listening side (client and server).
2. In Web Service terminology the active side (client) is consumer, the listening (server) is producer.
3. Web Services are machine to machine interface (unlikely the UI that is human to machine interface), because of that they have to have:
    - well defined (known upfront) contract. i.e. how to call it, what input parameters it accepts and their meaning, the structure and meaning of the output, etc.
    - and easy to parse (read by machine) input and output structure, e.g. XML, JSON, etc.
4. There are 2 approaches to define a web service
    - Contract first - better suited for SOAP web service where the contract is described in XML format in a file named WSDL, i.e. someone provides the contract and the developer generates automatically or writes manually code to consume or produce the contract. Despite that in REST there is OpenAPI, a JSON structure describing the contract (like WSDL for SOAP), it is more common the contract to be provided in human readable format (document with description English);
    - Code first â€“ more often used for producer side, i.e. the developer writes code based on the business requirements and some framework generates the contract or human readable documentation. This contract is shared with other developers who have to consume these web services
5. The Web Services (both SOAP and REST) support versioning and backward compatibility is an important topic when web services evolve
6. Better backward compatibility on the consumer side is achieved when [Tolerant Reader](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html) pattern is applied
 
## SOAP
1. Learn (basic level of understanding, only HTTP transport) about SOAP, WSDL and XSD (https://www.guru99.com/soap-simple-object-access-protocol.html)
2. JAX-WS/Apache CXF (the most popular implementation of JAX-WS) (relation of JAX-WS and Apache CXF is same like JPA and Hibernate) - https://www.baeldung.com/jax-ws
3. [JAXB](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/)

## REST
1. Read in depth about REST principles, maturity model (HATEOAS), [PayPal guidelines](https://github.com/paypal/api-standards/blob/master/api-style-guide.md)
2. Take a look on [OpenAPI and JSON Schema](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/start-here.html)
3. [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) (the most popular JSON to Java object mapper) and [JSON-B](https://www.baeldung.com/java-json-binding-api) (the JAXB equivalent for JSON) (just for info)
4. Swagger/OpenAPI and Springfox/Spring Docs - auto-generation of documentation. You can try to integrate [Spring Docs](https://springdoc.org/)

## Secondary Goal
1. Learn how to write integration tests for SOAP and REST web services, i.e. use consumer to test producers
2. For SOAP use generated by the producer WSDL and generate automatically consumer (maven plugin wrapping [wsimport](https://www.mojohaus.org/jaxws-maven-plugin/wsimport-mojo.html), then use Junit 5 and AssertJ to test the producer functionality (linked to practical goal)
3. For REST use the human readable auto-generated documentation (Swagger UI) and then write integration test using Junit 5, Spring WebClient (deprecated now RestTemplate)  and AssertJ to test the producer functionality (linked to practical goal).
4. For REST use the human readable auto-generated documentation (Swagger UI) and then write integration test using Junit 5, [Rest Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured ) and AssertJ to test the producer functionality (linked to practical goal)

## Practical Task
1. Integrate Apache CXF in Hangman app (in the latest Spring Boot + JPA/Hibernate version) and expose statistics as SOAP endpoint
    - [Hint](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/springboot.html#SpringBoot-SpringBootCXFJAX-WSStarter)
    - You can take a look on CXF auto-configuration to see how CXF is configured to work with Spring
2. Write integration test for exposed SOAP endpoint
3. Use Spring MVC to expose the Hangaman game functionality as REST API (list ongoing games, start game, get game information, make a try). Be careful to follow [PayPal guidelines](https://github.com/paypal/api-standards/blob/master/api-style-guide.md)
4. Integrate [Spring Docs](https://springdoc.org/) in Hangman app to auto-document exposed REST APIs
5. Write integration tests for exposed REST APIs, few with WebClient and few with Rest Assured to practise both ways of writing integration tests for REST
